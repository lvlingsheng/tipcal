The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [Y] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

## Notes

The first challenge is the UI design. For this APP, as the function is simple, how to design a simple but good looking UI is a bit complicated. 

The second challene is the Language. I used to use Objective-C, but for swift, there are so much to learn.

I am not satisfied with current version UI, may have better version later.
